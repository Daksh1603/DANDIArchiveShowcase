## Scripts information
The nwb_table_readme.py script allows one to parse through all the dandisets in DANDIArchive, extract metadata information
and validate files in each dandiset against NWBInspector. Further development will enable the script to test files/dandisets' compatibility
with NWB Explorer. Validation results and summary information are saved in a directory called validation_folder.
