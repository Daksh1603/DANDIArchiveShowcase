## Original proposal summary
The ever-growing body of data in Neuroscience, which has been enabled by the advancement of state-of-the-art techniques, calls forth collaborative attempts to make data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). 
Consequently, Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), an open-source software that defines components of a language for neurophysiology data, was born out of such need. NWB has thus exemplified as a sustainable biological data ecosystem,
but there lies the need of converting readily available datasets into NWB format to allow for further sharibility and producibility. With that said, this project aims to (i) convert a publicly available dataset into NWB format,
(ii) ensure NWB datasets' compatibility with NWB explorer (NWBE), (iii) and facilitate generality of the conversion process by investigating the sources of NWBE-NWB incompatibilities and ensuring essential metadata being added. This is a medium size project (175h).

## Overview
The development of this project has shifted entirely to the aforementioned aims (ii) amd (iii), that is systematically inspecting the
available dandisets of DANDI archive and validating their compatibility with NWBE. For information about all available dandisets generated by the scripts in this repo, please visit [here](validation_folder/README.md).
For details on how to run the scripts, please visit [here](README.md).
